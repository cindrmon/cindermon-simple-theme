# Cindermon Simple Theme

> The official theme for cindermon.cf!

## Features: 

- Very minimalistic design, only using one single css file, and that's it.
- There's nothing really special with this theme, it is my poor attempt at being a web designer, and this tells that I need more practice rather than just changing the font to default monospace of your browser and putting a gray background that closely resembles dark mode, and a couple doodads like padding and stuff.. I still haven't done that much on anything but those things, especially with special markdown integration, so this is the most I can do for now.
- This is pretty much a work in progress, so please be kind to me ;-;
